# Labs

# 1

## Web application

0. Register an AWS account if you don't have it. You will need it for next labs.
1. Develop and test a simple Python web application, that shows current time in Moscow.
> Research and use best practices and prod ready frameworks. Use linters for Python and Markdown. Don't forget to test it, time must be updated with a page refreshing.
2. Write a PYTHON.md file and describe all best practices that you could find. 
> The more practices you will list the more points you will get.
3. Write a README.md file in Markdown format.
> Research and use any good template that you like.
4. If you don't have a Github account create it. Then create a public repository `devops` and push your great app there.
> Create `app_python` folder for your application and PYTHON.md then put them there, leave README.md in the root directory.

## Bonus

1. Create your own web app, use any another language, it's up to you what it will show or do, use your imagination.
2. Follow all suggestions and steps from the main task.
4. Create `app_*` folder in the main project, replace`*` with language that you chose. Put new README.md inside that folder. Then push it to your `devops` repository.

## Containerization

1. Create a `Dockerfile` for your application.
> Research and use best practices. Use linter for Dockerfile.
2. Write a DOCKER.md file and describe all best practices that you could find.
> The more practices you will list the more points you will get.
3. Build an image and test it, make sure it works!
4. Create a public `docker hub` account if you don't have. Push your image there.
5. Run the image from your account and test it.
6. Update README.md in your root folder. Add the `Docker` part.
> You can also check for README.md templates.
7. Put `Dockerfile` and all required files into the app folder. Create a commit and push it to your `devops` repository.


## Bonus

1. Create a `Dockerfile` for the app that you created in the previous lab.
2. Follow all steps and suggestions from the main task.
3. Read about `Docker multi-stage builds`. Implement, if it makes a sense only.
